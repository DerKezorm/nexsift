"""Whether a newer nexsift is out, as in nexlore (after nexmail's update check).

At most once a day the public GitHub API is asked for the newest release. Nothing goes out but the question
itself: no names, no notes, no settings. Besides the logos (``services/icons.py``) it is the one place nexsift calls
out by itself, so the switch stands on the about page, where the answer shows, and the page says in a sentence what
goes out. Off means "not by itself": the button still asks.

The check is a side matter. Without a network, with GitHub down or answering an error, nothing on the page breaks: the
answer is simply not there. While the repository is private, GitHub answers "not found" and so says nothing either.
